PliBX
=====

A Light PBX for the Plivo Cloud and Framework



Stuff we will be using to develop:

* HTML5 Boilerplate. ( http://www.initializr.com/ )
* PHP/Yii or CodeIgniter. (Instead of using Node.js which I would love to, we will be using PHP because its the most supported platform on regular hostings...)
* Some cool template from themeforest.


We may use php only to build an API backend and use AngularJS for the frontend, but lets see :)
